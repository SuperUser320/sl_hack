A modification of the SL program written by Toyoda masashi, designed 
to "cure" bad typing by running a "steam locomotive" across the screen 
when 'sl' is typed.

This modification is designed to act as an _alternative_ to the 'ls'
command, by using highly sophistocated programming tecniques to
link multiple train cars together and populating them with folder
names.  In addition a railway name has also been added to more easily
identify the railcars.
